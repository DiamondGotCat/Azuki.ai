**To make this project bigger, we need to make the dataset bigger.**
Please cooperate.

### NOTE
Divided the dataset into the following six categories:
- **Extra Small** (xs) **:** Too Small Model (e.g., Testing Azuki.ai)
- **Small** (sm) **:** A small, highly efficient dataset for mobile devices (e.g., generating sentence continuations)
- **Medium** (md) **:** A medium-sized, slightly smart dataset for low-spec PCs (e.g., solving common sense problems)
- **Large** (lg) **:** A large, smart dataset for medium-spec PCs (e.g., solving general problems)
- **Extra Large** (xl) **:** An extra-large, high-spec dataset for a Mac M1 or so (e.g., solving math problems for high school students)
