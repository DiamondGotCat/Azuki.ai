# Azuki.ai
Small, text generation AI (Created by DiamondGotCat)

## Dataset Contribute
**To make this project bigger, we need to make the dataset bigger.**

In the future, we plan to divide the dataset into the following five categories:
- **Small** (sm) **:** A small, highly efficient dataset for mobile devices (e.g., generating sentence continuations)
- **Medium** (md) **:** A medium-sized, slightly smart dataset for low-spec PCs (e.g., solving common sense problems)
- **Large** (lg) **:** A large, smart dataset for medium-spec PCs (e.g., solving general problems)
- **Extra Large** (xl) **:** An extra-large, high-spec dataset for a Mac M3 or so (e.g., solving math problems for high school students)

## Files
- **data.json:** Training Dataset
- **execute.py:** Runner
- **training.py:** Training Script

## Customize Output
1. Edit data.json
